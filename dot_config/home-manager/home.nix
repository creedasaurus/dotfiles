    # # It is sometimes useful to fine-tune packages, for example, by applying

    # # parentheses. Maybe you want to install Nerd Fonts with a limited number of
    # # fonts?
    # (pkgs.nerdfonts.override { fonts = [ "FantasqueSansMono" ]; })

    # # You can also create simple shell scripts directly inside your
    # # configuration. For example, this adds a command 'my-hello' to your
    # # environment:
    # (pkgs.writeShellScriptBin "my-hello" ''

  #
  #  ~/.nix-profile/etc/profile.d/hm-session-vars.sh
  #
  # or
